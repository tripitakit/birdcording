#Birdcordings#

Appcelerator Titanium Alloy project for an iPad application aimed at the exploration of birds sounds
through searching and listening the xeno-canto recordings database.

Uses an Alloy custom sync adapter (ti-xenocanto-bb) to query and fetch results
using the xeno-canto webservice's API 2.0.

Version alpha-0.0.1. Basic functionalities implemented


__TODO__

* Manage play/pause/stop
* Design/implement UI (two views layout for query + results)
